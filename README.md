# AI/ML Learning Notes

A self-paced learning repository for understanding key AI/ML models and concepts with mathematical foundations and practical Python implementations.

## üìö Learning Modules

This repository contains structured learning materials for various AI/ML technologies. Each module includes:

- **README.md**: Concept explanation and learning objectives
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive Python code examples and implementations
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for running the code
- **LaTeX document (.tex)**: Mathematical foundations and theory (can be compiled to PDF)
- **Sample data**: Datasets for hands-on practice

### Available Modules

1. **[Transformers](./transformers/)** - Understanding attention mechanisms and transformer architecture
2. **[GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)](./gans/)** - Learning generative models and adversarial training
3. **[CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)](./cnns/)** - Mastering computer vision and convolutional architectures

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the module you want to learn
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the Jupyter notebook to start learning interactively
5. (Optional) Compile the LaTeX document for a comprehensive PDF reference

## üìñ How to Use

Each module is self-contained and can be studied independently. It's recommended to:

1. Start by reading the README.md for an overview
2. Review the LaTeX document for mathematical foundations
3. Work through the Jupyter notebook for hands-on practice
4. Experiment with the sample data to deepen understanding
